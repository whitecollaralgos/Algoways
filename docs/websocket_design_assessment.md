# AlgoWays WebSocket Design Assessment

This document provides a final validation assessment of the WebSocket proxy system design based on the available documentation. The system has been designed to be fully broker-agnostic while using Angel Broking as the pilot implementation.

## Assessment Summary

### Broker Integration & Architecture

| Feature | Status | Details | Documentation |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Broker Agnosticism** | ✅ Implemented | Uses `BaseBrokerWebSocketAdapter` and factory pattern to support multiple brokers (Angel, Zerodha, etc.) with a common interface. One user connects to one broker at a time. | [broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md)<br>[websocket_implementation.md](websocket_implementation.md) (Sections 1, 4)<br>[websocket.md](websocket.md) |
| **Authentication** | ✅ Implemented | AlgoWays API keys for client authentication. `AuthService` validates keys and fetches broker-specific tokens (`auth_token`, `feed_token`) and `user_id` from database. | [websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 5)<br>[websocket.md](websocket.md) (Section 4.1) |
| **Symbol Mapping** | ✅ Implemented | `SymbolMapper` uses the `SymToken` model from database to map user-friendly symbols/exchanges to broker-specific tokens/exchanges. | [websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 4)<br>[broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md) |

### Market Data Capabilities

| Feature | Status | Details | Documentation |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Subscription Modes** | ✅ Implemented | Supports LTP (Mode 1), Quote (Mode 2), and Depth (Mode 4). `BrokerCapabilityRegistry` tracks supported modes per broker. | [websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 3)<br>[broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md) |
| **Depth Level Support** | ✅ Implemented | Supports multiple depth levels (5, 20, 30). Handles different levels based on broker and exchange capabilities with fallback logic. | [websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 3)<br>[broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md) |
| **Broker Limitations** | ✅ Implemented | `BrokerCapabilityRegistry` defines supported exchanges and depth levels per broker. Provides informative error messages or falls back gracefully. | [websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 3)<br>[broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md) |

### System Qualities

| Feature | Status | Details | Documentation |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Error Handling** | ✅ Implemented | Checks for invalid modes, depth levels, and symbols. Standardized error responses with appropriate logging. | [broker_factory.md](broker_factory.md)<br>[websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) |
| **Scalability** | ✅ Implemented | ZeroMQ pub/sub for decoupling the WebSocket adapter from the proxy/clients. Asynchronous client connection handling. | [websocket.md](websocket.md) (Sections 1, 3)<br>[websocket_implementation.md](websocket_implementation.md) (Sections 1.1, 2) |
| **Security** | ✅ Implemented | API key authentication required. Environment variables for sensitive keys. TLS recommended for production. | [websocket.md](websocket.md) (Section 9)<br>[websocket_auth_and_mapping.md](websocket_auth_and_mapping.md) (Section 1) |
| **Cross-Platform**   | ✅ Implemented | System runs reliably on Linux and Windows, with platform-specific optimizations (event loop policy, signal handling, port management) for Windows compatibility. Port conflict handling during debug reloads addressed. | [websocket_implementation.md](websocket_implementation.md) (Section 5)<br>[websocket.md](websocket.md) (Section 7) |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Good | Logical organization in separate documents. Code examples provided. Cross-references between documents. | All `.md` files |


## Overall Assessment

The WebSocket proxy system design for AlgoWays demonstrates a well-structured, fully broker-agnostic approach that effectively addresses all the core requirements. After comprehensive review and refinement, the system showcases the following key strengths:

- **Flexible broker integration**: The factory pattern (`broker_factory.md`) and abstract adapter base class provide a clean way to add support for the 20+ brokers planned for AlgoWays. The design ensures only one user can connect to one broker at a time, as specified in the requirements.

- **Depth level support**: The system properly handles different market depth levels (5, 20, 30, 50), with appropriate fallback mechanisms when a broker doesn't support a requested depth level. The `BrokerCapabilityRegistry` tracks supported features per broker/exchange.

- **Pilot implementation with Angel**: While maintaining broker-agnosticism throughout the codebase, the system uses Angel Broking as its pilot implementation, with clear examples of how the abstract interfaces are implemented for this specific broker.

- **Clean separation of concerns**: Authentication, symbol mapping, broker capabilities, and WebSocket communication are clearly separated into distinct components, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

- **Consistent error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and standardized error responses ensure clients receive helpful information when broker limitations are encountered or features are unsupported.

- **Scalability**: The use of ZeroMQ for message distribution provides an efficient pub/sub mechanism that can handle multiple concurrent users with minimal resource usage.

- **Robust cross-platform support**: The system has been enhanced and tested to ensure reliable operation on both Linux and Windows environments, incorporating necessary platform-specific adjustments.

- **Documentation consistency**: All documentation files now consistently describe a broker-agnostic approach with Angel as the pilot implementation, with no misleading broker-specific terminology.

The design establishes a solid foundation for the WebSocket system, with Angel as the pilot implementation, while ensuring the architecture will seamlessly support additional brokers as they are integrated.
