# CSRF Audit Report - algoways Project

**Date:** 2025-05-30 (Updated: 2025-05-31)
**Auditor:** Cascade AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) audit conducted on the `algoways` project.
The project utilizes Flask and Flask-WTF, which provides a strong foundation for CSRF protection.

Overall, the CSRF protection mechanisms are well-implemented.
- Standard web forms and AJAX requests are generally protected using CSRF tokens.
- API endpoints (exempted from web CSRF protection) use API key authentication, which is not vulnerable to CSRF.
- WebSocket communication uses an explicit API key authentication step after connection, mitigating CSRF risks for WebSocket actions.

One minor recommendation is to enhance the logout functionality to use the POST method with CSRF token protection.

## 2. Audit Scope

The audit focused on the following areas:
-   Flask application setup (`app.py`)
-   CSRF token implementation in HTML templates (`templates/`)
-   CSRF token handling in client-side JavaScript (`static/js/`)
-   Authentication mechanisms for CSRF-exempted API endpoints (`restx_api/`)
-   CSRF protection for WebSocket (SocketIO) communications (`websocket_proxy/`)
-   Session cookie configuration (SameSite attribute)
-   Protection of sensitive actions like logout.

## 3. Findings and Recommendations

### 3.1. CSRF Protection Setup (Flask-WTF)
-   **Finding:** `Flask-WTF` and its `CSRFProtect` extension are correctly initialized in `app.py`.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `WTF_CSRF_ENABLED` is configurable via the `CSRF_ENABLED` environment variable.
    -   `WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT` is configurable via the `CSRF_TIME_LIMIT` environment variable.
    -   The REST API blueprint (`api_v1_bp`) is explicitly exempted using `csrf.exempt(api_v1_bp)`, which is appropriate as it uses separate API key authentication.
-   **Status:** Good.

### 3.2. HTML Forms and CSRF Tokens
-   **Finding:** HTML forms in the `templates/` directory correctly include CSRF tokens using `{{ csrf_token() }}` as a hidden input field (e.g., in `login.html`, `profile.html`, `setup.html`, etc.).
-   **Status:** Good.

### 3.3. AJAX Requests and CSRF Tokens
-   **Finding:**
    -   A CSRF meta tag (`<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">`) is present in `templates/base.html`.
    -   JavaScript code in `templates/base.html` defines `getCSRFToken()` to read this meta tag.
    -   `static/js/app.js` uses this `getCSRFToken()` function to include an `X-CSRFToken` header in fetch requests.
    -   A helper `fetchWithCSRF` is also defined in `base.html` to automate adding the token.
-   **Status:** Good. The mechanism for protecting AJAX requests is correctly implemented.

### 3.4. API Endpoint Authentication (CSRF Exempted)
-   **Finding:** The `restx_api/` endpoints (exempted from CSRF protection) use an API key passed in the request body (e.g., `data.get('apikey', None)` in `restx_api/place_order.py`).
-   **Verification:** The `services/place_order_service.py` confirms that this API key is validated against the database (`get_auth_token_broker(api_key)`). If the API key is missing or invalid, the request is rejected. This method is not vulnerable to CSRF.
-   **Status:** Good.

### 3.5. WebSocket (SocketIO) CSRF Protection
-   **Finding:**
    -   The WebSocket proxy server (`websocket_proxy/server.py`) handles client connections.
    -   Connection establishment itself does not grant authenticated status based on session cookies.
    -   Clients must send an explicit "authenticate" or "auth" message containing an `api_key` after connecting.
    -   The `authenticate_client` method in `websocket_proxy/server.py` validates this `api_key`.
-   **Recommendation (Minor - Defense-in-Depth):** Consider adding an `Origin` header check during the WebSocket handshake in `websocket_proxy/server.py` (specifically in `handle_client`) to ensure connections only originate from allowed frontend domains. The `websockets` library would require manual implementation of this check. However, the current API key authentication within the WebSocket protocol is the primary and effective CSRF mitigation here.
-   **Status:** Good. The primary mechanism (API key in message) prevents CSRF.

### 3.6. Session Cookie Configuration
-   **Finding:** The `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` attribute is not explicitly set in `app.py`. Flask's default is `'Lax'`.
-   **Analysis:** `'Lax'` prevents cookies from being sent on cross-origin POST requests, which is the main CSRF vector for state changes. Combined with Flask-WTF's token protection, this is generally sufficient.
-   **Status:** Acceptable.

### 3.7. Logout Functionality
-   **Finding (Previous):** The logout route (`/auth/logout` in `blueprints/auth.py`) was a GET request, which posed a CSRF risk.
-   **Finding (Current - 2025-05-31):** The logout route has been updated to accept only POST requests (`@auth_bp.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])`). With Flask-WTF's CSRF protection enabled globally, this route is now automatically protected and requires a valid CSRF token.
-   **Risk:** Mitigated.
-   **Recommendation (Previous):** Change the logout route to accept only POST requests and ensure it's protected by a CSRF token.
-   **Status:** Fixed. The logout functionality is now secure against CSRF.

## 4. Conclusion

The `algoways` project has robust CSRF protection in place for most of its components. The use of Flask-WTF, API key authentication for APIs, and explicit API key authentication for WebSockets are effective measures. The previously identified issue with the logout functionality has been addressed by changing it to a POST request, which is now protected by CSRF tokens.
